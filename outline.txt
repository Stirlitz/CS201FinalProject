Goals:

- convert distance-time to velocity-time to acceleration-time
- output
- plot

- input distance data and difference between time (cannot have missing points)
- ask whether want velocity table, acceleration table, or both

Classes:

- main
- distance->velocity / velocity->acceleration converter
- table printer
